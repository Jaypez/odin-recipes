<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the only meatloaf I ever liked! Seasoned with fresh onion,a touch of bell pepper, and glazed with a sweet
    ketchup sauce. For our small family, we cook one loaf and freeze the other to cook at a later time.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup crushed saltine crackers</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped green bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground marjoram</li>
    <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Combine ground beef, cracker crumbs, tomato sauce, eggs, onion, bell pepper, salt, thyme, and marjoram in a
        large bowl and mix well. Shape beef mixture into two equally sized loaves. Place both loaves in a 9x13 inch
        baking dish. Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Meanwhile, mix ketchup and corn syrup in
        a small bowl to make a glaze.</li>
    <li>Remove baking dish from the oven and remove foil. Brush glaze onto the loaves. Return baking dish to the oven
        uncovered, and continue baking until loaves are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
